# Key concepts

1. We keep incoming `Check` command request open till we receive `CheckResponse`
2. Messages are not saved before we get a `CheckResponse`
3. We use queues and separate ML service for higher throughput
4. We use LRU cache to retrieve full history, we dont invalidate it, we update it manually when new message is saved
5. Messages are saved into hard drive queue, so in case of server crash or restart they wont be lost
6. We use queue level batching
7. Graceful shutdown

# Trade offers

1. We need higher RAM for storing all cache
2. We can observe 1-2 seconds delay for real time data and http response
3. Due to cache, we potentially need to locks to keep cache consistent, add batching for before sending for queue and save them as batch
4. We keep http request open to send response, but we need anyway (not much a trade offer)
5. Due to batching timeout we can loose some messages before they were published into the queue, use without batching
