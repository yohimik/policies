# Auth

We will use middlewares in crud service

## External messages

Add support for generating bearer token attached in the headers

## Dashboard/admin

Recommended separate auth service (auth gateway), adds user id or external id to the headers or doesnt forward request in case of invalid credentials

JWT tokens (access, refresh)

For login recommended OAUth2 integrated with google or other third parties (no need to save passwords).

If OAuth is not an option then use jwt tokens from auth service
